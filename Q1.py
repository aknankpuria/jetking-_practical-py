#In Python Programming, how many types of errors are possible and define them.

#1 syntax error
    #syntax error occurs when the code is not in proper format.

x=15

# if x==15
#     print("x is 15")

# in upper code there is syntax error because we have not use : in if statement.

if x==15:
    print("x is 15")    

    #now this is error free
